# Todos

- created "debug" flag
- validate rules
- add pubsub for devtools
- rename position without prefix "INSERT_"
- export constants

# Resolved

- INSERT_INSTEAD should not kill own dispatched actions
- implement "extendId" logic
- correctly implement throttle, and debounce logic
- implement delay logic (= current throttle)
